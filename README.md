# Multai-Xcode-ColorTheme

A colorful, yet easy on the eyes theme for Xcode. I created this color theme because most themes, if not all of the ones I've encountered, have the same color values for Classes, Functions, Constants, etc. This theme has different colors for each while trying to not be overwhelmingly colorful.

If you like it or have colorful suggestions (see what I did there), tweet me @Rizk_Taker

Happy coding!
