# Multai Colortheme for Xcode

Multai is a colorful, yet easy on the eyes theme for Xcode, and it is inspired by Atom's One Dark. I created this colortheme because most themes, if not all of the ones I've encountered, have the same color values for Classes, Functions, Constants, etc. This theme has different colors for each while trying to not be overwhelmingly colorful.

If you like it or have colorful suggestions (see what I did there), tweet me @Rizk_Taker

### Directions

1. Clone this repository 
2. Move Multai.dtvcolortheme to: /Users/$(YOU)/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
3. Restart Xcode and go to Preferences > Fonts & Colors > select Multai from the left menu
4. Crush some code
